# SCRPT# Sudden Change Rotary Pattern Tracker (SCRPT)  
*A high-performance alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pattern recognition.*  

## Features  
- âœ… **Fully Transparent** â€“ Every validation can be traced back to a specific pattern type.  
- ðŸš€ **Higher Accuracy** â€“ Outperforms traditional CNNs in benchmark tests.  
- ðŸš€ **Faster Processing** â€“ Efficient background management reduces computational overhead.
-  âœ¨ Key Features
ðŸŽ¯ Background Management
Enhanced Learning & Validation: Manages backgrounds to speed up both the learning process and the validation process, significantly improving SCRPT's efficiency.
Intelligent Pattern Separation:
Stores background patterns separately from useful patterns during data collection.
Uses a simple conditional rule:
python
IF PATTERN == PATTERN[-1]: STORE AS BACKGROUND_PATTERN  
ELSE: STORE AS USEFUL_PATTERN 

Optimized Data Processing:
This separation allows the model to cluster, clean, and optimize useful patterns, which typically represent ~25% of the total data.

ðŸ”„ Pattern Collection
SCRPT employs an advanced double-rotation method to efficiently extract patterns from datasets:

Core Collection Process:

For each non-zero element identified as a pattern center, SCRPT:

Captures the 8 surrounding elements (primary rotation)

For each of these 8 elements, captures their 8 surrounding elements (secondary rotation)

Sums these secondary rotation elements

Data Storage:
Each collected pattern is stored in an array containing:

Coordinates of the pattern center

Data number (identifier)

Associated label

The 8 summed values from secondary rotations

MNIST Dataset Example:

python
if pixel_value != 0:  # Identify pattern center
    store_pattern(
        center_coordinates,
        data_number,
        label,
        [sum(secondary_rotation_1), ..., sum(secondary_rotation_8)]
    )
Key Advantages:

Efficient spatial pattern extraction through double-rotation

Comprehensive data preservation (coordinates, identifiers, and processed values)

Optimized for image datasets like MNIST
